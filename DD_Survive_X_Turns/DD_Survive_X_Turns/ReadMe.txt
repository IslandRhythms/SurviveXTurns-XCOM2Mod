To activate this mission, you must complete a covert action called [code]Find the Advent Spy[/code]

The only other mod really required is highlander because this mission was built with it. The other mods are for handling a squad size larger than 6.

Your team will be tasked with sending in troops to defend an area for x amount of turns and extract with an item. Enemies will spawn on every turn. You will not be able to extract until the timer runs out. The timer will only start if you have possession of the item. If you lose possession, the timer will continue but you risk failure if not recovered and extracted.
You can send in a max of 10 soldiers. However, you can go into the ini file and change that number to be whatever you want.
Many rewards are given so this is a high risk, high reward mission.

[u]AI changes[/u]
In XComAI.ini, changes were made so the enemy AI will move to your position. However, a side effect is that this makes it happen on all missions.
You can change this by going into the ini file and commenting all the lines by adding a semicolon in front.
If you only want the AI change for this mission, you will have to go in and change that file every time.

[h1]I do not know if this mod will work with whatever mods you have installed or want to install. I have a bunch of mods installed on my game and it didn't cause any problems. Feel free to try it with whatever mods you are running and comment if it causes a problem or not.[/h1]

[h2] Huge Thanks to Σ3245 for their prison break mission. I wouldn't have been able to do this the way I wanted without using their mission as a template [/h2]
